    <h1>About the Author</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.mnu.edu/academics/faculty/addison-lucchi">Addison Lucchi</a>) (MLIS, MBA) is an Instructional & Research Librarian at MidAmerica Nazarene University. Currently, he is working on an interdisciplinary PhD from the University of Missouri-Kansas City, in Educational Leadership and English. His current research focus is in applying story and narrative principles towards the identity development and professional development of teachers, especially in a higher education context. His previous research has centered in using stories as pedagogical case studies (e.g., book chapter in <i>The Pedagogy of Harry Potter</i>), and on creative approaches to teaching research (e.g., book chapter in <i>for Library Career Advancement</i>, and Brick and Click conference proceedings article on research for creative writing). Thus, looking at the connections between single/counter stories, writing/literacy, and teaching/learning within a higher education context is in line with his professional expertise and academic focus area.</p>
