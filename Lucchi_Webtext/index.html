        <h1>Welcome to this Webtext! (An introduction)</h1>
    
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg&feature=emb_title"><i>“Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity… …when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.” (Adichie, 2009)</i></blockquote> </p>
            <p> Many classrooms are not conducted in a way that caters to the needs of all types of learners; rather, the preferred learning styles of teachers often dominants the classroom. Without intentional reflection and care, teachers will always lean towards biased instruction--sometimes, at the expense of their students. Single views on what teaching/learning, curriculum development, and power structures in the classroom look like can significantly hinder student learning--while also leading to linguistic inequalities as the learning needs/preferences of many students are stifled or silenced. The result can be damaging not only to students' learning, but also towards their identity development.</p>

            <p>In her Ted talk, "The Dangers of a Single Story", Chimamanda Adichie describes the problems of what she terms the "single story". This webtext will look at teaching and learning as a form of rhetoric—applying the notion of a “single story” to argue for why teachers should provide opportunity for individual autonomy in the classroom, cater to all learning styles, and allow for freedom in curriculum development, rather than impose their own “single stories” of teaching and learning on their students—thus contributing to inequalities in education, as some students receive the kind of instruction they need, but others do not. Furthermore, this article will explore the material and emotional consequences of this kind of teacher-centered and biased instruction occurring in the classroom. Through exploring SoTL (the scholarship of teaching and learning) and connecting it to stories (single vs. counter), this article will discuss how teaching according to “single story” methodologies of pedagogy and curriculum development can be seen as a form of linguistic inequality in the classroom; while teaching in a varied, learner-centered way allows for students to learn more effectively, and grow more fully and holistically. Narrative theory will also be used to connect the concept of single stories to identity development, and to help illustrate the consequences that these single stories can create not only pedagogically, but also developmentally. </p>

            <p>  This webtext, rather than providing a straightforward "problem/solution" argument, will look at the topic through a variety of different lenses/perspectives. You may view these perspectives (on the left) in any order you would like--however, as you read, try to keep each perspective you have already read in the back of your mind and make your own connections. Consider instances you may have experienced examples of the educational inequalities specified. And, consider for yourself how these problems might be rectified. After you read each of these subtopics/perspectives, you will be ready to view the conclusion: on a model for transformative education. This final section ties all of the other areas together and makes some final concluding thoughts. </p>
                
            <p> Specifically, then, this webtext will look at this topic through the following angles/perspectives:
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li>Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</li>
                    <li>Narrative Theory</li>
                    <li>SoTL & Learner-Centered Pedagogy</li>
                    <li>Power Structures in Teaching & Learning</li>
                    <li>Participatory Learning Communities</li>
                    <li>Postmodern Curriculum Development</li>
                    <li>Conclusion: Transformative Education (view last)</li>
                  </ul>
            <p>   Hopefully, this webtext creates questions in your mind. For teachers, how do our "single stories" negatively impact our students? For students, what possibilities might there be for transformative learning if your stories were legitamized in the classroom? For all of us, how might we dismantle these various expressions of the notion of a "single story" in the classroom and beyond? This text, then, does not provide answers (though, it does providing observations and culminating thoughts in the conclusion); rather, it is meant to present questions. The answers to those questions will, of course, depend upon the teacher, the learner, and their specific teaching and learning contexts.</p>
