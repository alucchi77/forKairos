        <h1>Narrative Theory</h1>
    
        <p> Narrative theory (or narrative inquiry) is based upon the premise that “as human beings, we come to understand and give meaning to our lives through story” (Trahar, 2009, p. 2). Thus, narrative theory sees storytelling as a means of qualitative research and discovery—as shared storytelling is a form of ethnography, and narratives focus “on the meanings that people ascribe to their experiences” (p. 2). Narrative theory scholars Phelan and Rabinowitz describe narrative as a “rhetorical act”—stating that “narrative is somebody telling somebody else, on some occasion, and for some purposes, that something happened to someone or somebody” (2012, p. 3). </p>
            
            <p> Thus, narrative theory includes the stories that we tell ourselves—and, because of its ability to highlight the fact that we often ascribe disparate meanings to life events and tell ourselves different stories even about the same experiences, narrative theory can promote “a greater sensitivity to social and cultural differences” than some other forms of qualitative research (p. 3). Ultimately, narrative theory stems from the “assumption that narrative is a basic human strategy for coming to terms with fundamental elements of our experience” (Ohio State University, 2020, para. 1). If humans are, then, wired for story, it follows that storytelling could potentially serve as an ideal means not only for us to better understand ourselves (as individuals, and as teachers) as we frame our own experiences as narrative, but also to better understand those who have different perspectives—and come from different backgrounds—than our own. </p>

            <p>  Narrative theory offers some profound applications to the higher education classroom context. When we are able to view our lives as narratives—and recognize that others have their own stories, their own ways of understanding themselves and others (see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>), this impacts every part of who we are. Applying narrative theory to my teaching, means recognizing that the meaning I ascribe to my learning experience may be very different than the meaning another learner ascribes. It means that while I connect my learning to my own past and towards my ideal future (plotting a cohesive narrative in my brain), another student’s learning fits into a completely different, individualized narrative.  All learners bring their own strengths and weaknesses, their own backgrounds and experiences, their own motivations and goals to the classroom—thus, learning fits into students’ personal narratives in different ways. Not all learners learn the same way (see: <a href="learnercentered.html">SoTL & Learner-Centered Pedagogy</a>)—thus, educators should come to an understanding that all learners must have freedom in crafting their own stories—their own educational narratives. Teachers, then, serve as facilitators of these stories—providing the framework for students to learn and acting as guides as students navigate the complexities of their educational growth and narrative connectedness. </p>
                <p>   Another way to look at this concept, is through recognizing that not all students view education, or literacy, in the same way. The way literacy fits into the personal narratives of teachers will likely differ from the way it fits into the narrative of their students. Not only will different learning styles and goals account for these differences, but also concepts of race, ideology, and trauma. While a privileged member of society may hold to one definition of literacy (and one approach to developing it), the previous experiences of other learners may cause completely different forms of literacy (and different methods of applying it to one’s life) to be relevant and useful. It is alright for there to be differences in the way different people approach literacy, and a variety of ways that reading, writing, and other literacies fit into learners’ narrative arch and identity development.     </p>
