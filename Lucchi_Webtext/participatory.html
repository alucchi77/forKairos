        <h1>Participatory Learning Communities</h1>
    
        <p> In her book <i>Black Literate Lives</i>, Maisha Fisher discusses literacy as a sociological phenomenon—i.e., she ties literacy specifically to the contexts of its community (2009). Specifically, she describes learning as a communal act (using example from the narratives of Frederick Douglas, Malcolm X, Harriet Jacobs, and others) to demonstrate how literacy obliges those who are learning “to teach others” and “to share” (Fisher, 2009, p. 16). In this way, Fisher describes teaching and learning—specifically, the teaching and learning of literacy—as intimately connected (2009). As a communal force, literacy (both teaching and learning) has the capacity to bring those together of different backgrounds, to merge different forms of expression, and to allow subject matter to be explored through a variety of learning styles and perspectives. Why is it, then, that teaching and learning are often isolated from one another in the college classroom; that the narratives of teacher and learner are often so far removed from each other, that their story goals are entirely disparate, rather than interconnected and mutually motivated towards holistic learning?
        </p>
     
        <p>  In her book, Fisher also describes what she terms “participatory learning communities”—i.e., “venues, activities, and events that encourage reading, writing, dialogue, and community action” (2008, p. 90). She recounts practices and experiences from the poet activists of the late twentieth century to show how they actively engaged in such participatory learning communities—how they utilized libraries, open mics, musical gatherings, etc. as institutions that encouraged reading, writing, speaking, and doing the word (p. 89). Through open mic events, newer poets were able to form relationships with veteran poets, allowing a system of exchange and learning—the “reciprocal teaching and learning that takes place among scribes and lovers of words” (p. 100). Fisher specifically specifies that “unlike many classrooms, it was not limited to singular notions of literacy, as poetry could be expressed through written text, freestyling, rapping, acoustic instruments, and even dance” (p. 100). These poet activists engaged in reciprocal teaching and learning, and they refused to assign hierarchies to different types of learning or literacy (2009)—furthermore, they connected their learning, reading, writing, etc. to their daily lives and communities (2009). Fisher states that the participatory learning communities these poet activists engaged in “have much to teach the education world about how to create a climate for literacy teaching and learning” (2006, p. 116).
        </p>
     
        <p>Indeed, the college classroom rarely fits into Fisher’s definition of a participatory learning community—as hierarchies of teacher vs. learner and rigid definitions of learning/literacy prevent the reciprocal and participatory environment she describes. But imagine a college classroom where all students—despite their learning style, preferred mode of literacy, culture, or background—are encouraged to be fully themselves and present within the classroom, engaging in both teaching and learning in equal parts, approaching the subject matter at hand with the freedom to explore. Imagine a college classroom where the teacher acts as facilitator to learning, but also engages in that learning themselves—inviting students to share power and learn in a way that is efficacious for them. Imagine a college classroom that, like the communities of the poet activists that Fisher describes, allows learners to participate in a shared exploration into a topic of mutual interest, and encourages them to apply the lessons learned through this experience to their daily lives and non-academic communities. This kind of participatory classroom community would allow all students to share their stories and would help eliminate the single story mentality that dominates many higher education experiences (see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>).
