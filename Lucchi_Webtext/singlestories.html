        <h1>Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</h1>
    
        <p>Before reading this section, watch the TED Talk video below: “The Danger of a Single Story”, but Chimamanda Adichie.</p>

        <p>In her TED Talk, Chimamanda Adichie discusses how our lives and cultures “are composed of many overlapping stories” (2009). She shares the story of how she found her unique and authentic cultural voice—and she warns “that if we hear only a single story about another person or country, we risk a critical misunderstanding” (2009). Adichie describes a single story as the type of story perpetuated by showing a group of people “as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again” (2009). Thus, single stories are narratives and perceptions perpetuated by the dominant/majority group.  The reality, of course, is that these kinds of single stories create stereotypes and erode intercultural community (Tanaka, 2005). </p>
            <p>However, when members of an academic community are encouraged to tell and listen to each other’s different stories, acknowledging that there is no single story, this mutual exchange and dialogue can lead to an increased interconnectedness and a more unified intercultural community (Tanaka, 2005). Counter stories, then, involve alternate perspectives (stories/narratives) that run counter to dominant narratives. Often times, the stories of those from a dominant or majority group are seen as “true” and widely accepted as such—while the stories of those from marginalized and minority groups are “not legitimatized by society” (p. 23, 2013). Thus, counter-stories speak of social injustice and promote social justice (2013). Creating an academic community that focuses on counter-storytelling allows for “productive discussions about race and racism in a racially diverse group” as students, teachers, and other community members “go against the grain of stock stories, uncover concealed stories, draw lessons from resistance stories and generate emerging/transforming stories that can lead us toward a more just society shaped by all of us as active and valued citizens” (Bell, 2010, p. 110-111).</p>
	 <p>We are specifically looking at this concept of single stories and counter stories within the rhetorical context of teaching and learning. All teachers have their own beliefs, values, and ideologies related to teaching and learning—their own experiences that influence both their teaching practice and their educational theory adoption. Some teachers have very limited definitions of what constitutes learning or literacy—and, it is often educators who get to determine “who gets counted among the literate and what literate practices… are valued” (Fisher, 2009, p. 17).  When students with counter stories of learning/literacy show up in the classroom, they can challenge teachers’ pedagogical and personal ideologies—thus, when counter stories show up, conflict often occurs, as teachers demonstrate rhetorical resistance to change—to adapting from their single story mentalities. However, when teachers hold fast to their own single stories of what teaching and learning should look like, they can actually hinder student learning—as their story of what successful teaching/learning looks like may match up with some students’ own notions, but not with others. There are, unfortunately, dominant stories within higher education that often prevail over the counter stories of minority learners. Research shows, however, that not all learners learn in the same ways (see: <a href="learnercentered.html">SoTL & Learner-Centered Pedagogy</a>). Additionally, not recognizing the personal and cultural stories of other learners can have negative effects on their development and learning. Thus, excluding certain types of learners, through the promotion of single pedagogical stories or through ignoring their individual life narratives, can be damaging to students—academically, but also in terms of their personal development and sense of belonging.</p>
	 <p>What can be learned from these kinds of pedagogical conflicts between counter stories and single stories in the classroom? Teachers can recognize that there are other narratives, other stories of successful teaching and learning that are different from their own—thus, they can both allow for more individual autonomy in the classroom, and teach in a way that caters to all styles of learning. Students can recognize that not all fellow students (and, not all teachers) will understand or present information the same way that they would. Thus, students can seek to broaden their horizons as learners, not only growing through learning the subject matter, but also intentionally striving to grow in “non-ideal” forms of learning. However, since student learning—and the identity development that stems from students’ learning—is the primary goal of education, the primary responsibility to consider alternate counter stories falls on teachers.</p>
